## Razorgore the Untamed
* Conflagration - Conflagration deals Fire damage and **disorients the Main Tank for 10 seconds.**
* Fireball Volley - Inflicts Fire damage to nearby enemies.
### The Fight - Phase 1
* 4 Tanks, split into groups of two, either side of the south/west platform
* Tank 1 - Focus on
Death Talon Dragonspawn - Dragonkin mob that have high amounts of health and high damage.
* Tank 2 - Focus on
Blackwing Mage - casters that have high amounts of damage, but really low health.
Blackwing Legionnaire - melee mobs with medium health and damage. They aren't very dangerous on their own, just watch for their Cleave.
### The Fight - Phase 2
#### Main Tank
Will breakes the last egg as it will generate infinite agro 
#### Off-tanks
Focus on being second on threat as you will need to tank it for 10 seconds when the main tank gets **Conflagration**

## Vaelastrasz the Corrupt 
* Burning Adrenaline - Damage done increased by 100%. Spells cast are all instant. **Reduces max health by 5% every second. Deals 4376 to 5624 damage to surrounding allies on death. Every 45 seconds, Vael will give Burning Adrenaline to whoever is on top of his threat list**
* Flame Breath - **Inflicts 3500 to 4500 Fire damage to enemies in a cone in front of the caster.**'
### The Fight
* Flask
* 200 FR is advised (inc LBRS buff & Pally Aura) 
This is enough FR to help with the breath WITHOUT giving up too much MIT & TPS
#### Tank Swaps
Due to how the boss is scripted, AFTER the tank get Burning Adrenaline, the next Flame Breath will kill the Main tank.
Off-tanks will need to run to the MAIN TANKS position at the end of that next Flame Breath cast
